"""
This is a match to sample task to train odin.
One object is presented in the center. Animal has to saccade to the 
matching object. The non-match object is presented with a short delay. 
The delay is progressively decreased over days
For the two objects import the objects.py module. Colors of the object 
are different for starters just to help Odin.
